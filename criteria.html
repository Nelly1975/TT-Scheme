Candidates will be shortlisted after the interview stage and will be required to undergo a Combat Engineer Course in the School of Military Engineering, DFTC. On successful completion of the course candidates will then be offered placements on the TT scheme. Failure to successfully complete the Combat Engineer Course will result in a candidate not being offered a place on the TT Scheme. Further military training will continue throughout the entire period of the scheme.</dd>
